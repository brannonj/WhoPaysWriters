"""This publication was terrible to work with only because they made a major editorial error. They ran the first draft of my piece without including any of their own or my edits. I caught the mistake right away, emailed them, and it was fixed about 5 hours later. But the annoying thing about this is: they at first wanted me to write a regular column, but the day after this happened I got an email saying they no longer had the money to do that. Correlation doesn't imply causation, sure, but this just goes to show that freelancers often find themselves in impossible situations.""",Contract: Yes,$0.25,False,Medium reporting,Paid in 1 month ,svg-2,Platform: digital,Jstor Daily,Cold pitch (no pre-existing relationship),Rights: First Serial Rights,feature,2000,2016
