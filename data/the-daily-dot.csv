"""DD is a supremely amazing company to freelance for. I've been a freelance writer for 5 years and The Daily Dot tops the chart in terms of communication, speed of payment, and satisfaction of the edits. They even have a little weekly award called The Dotties where the editors send out a newsletter of their favorite stories of the week.""",Contract: No,$0.15,False,Medium reporting,Paid in 15 days ,svg-1,Platform: digital,The Daily Dot,Cold pitch (no pre-existing relationship),Rights: First Serial Rights,feature,1000,2018
