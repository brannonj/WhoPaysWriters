"""As previously reported invoices are processed by accounting the 15th and 30th of each month, and cash is direct deposited 30 days following the invoice process date.

I have been writing for various Vice Media sections for about a year, and this is the first contract I have signed. It's a one-off arrangement, and only applied to the one assignment. The editor who gave me the contract has since left the company, and I haven't been given another contract since.
