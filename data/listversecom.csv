"""I first had a piece published by them in 2016, and it was a great experience: they let me know within 24 hours that they wanted to publish it, and I was paid a week later. Two years on, a very different story. I submitted a new article in late 2017, but not until almost FIVE MONTHS later did they respond. It is supposed to be only a few weeks before they let you know one way or the other. They did accept it in the end, and after this point I was paid within a month. I am less bothered about the payment time, even if longer than in 2016, more about the absurd length of time it took to tell me if they wanted it or not. Also, in 2016 the article length was requested as being 1200-1500 words maximum, now it has to be at least 1800, but the amount of money you are paid - $100 - is still the same as it was two years ago, so you have to write more without getting paid more. In short, I would no longer recommend writing for Listverse, it has definitely gone downhill in multiple ways.""",Contract: No,$0.05,False,Medium reporting,Paid in 1 month ,svg-2,Platform: digital,Listverse.com,Ongoing/pre-existing relationship with editor or publication,Rights: All rights,feature,1950,2018
