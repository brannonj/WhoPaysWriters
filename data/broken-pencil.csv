"""The odd dollar amount is due to my being an American and the publication being Canadian. The original agreed upon price was $100 for my somewhat short (about 650 words) humorous fiction. I received a check about three months after publication, but was told by my bank that depositing a check drawn on a Canadian bank would entail a process of fees and so forth that would make it more advisable for me to seek alternate payment method. Went back to publisher - who was very congenial during this - and arranged PayPal payment, which involved fees. As I recall, I netted about $87 of the $100 (something with exchange rates in there, no doubt.)""",Contract: No,$0.12,False,Little to no reporting,,ng-hide,Platform: print,Broken Pencil,Cold pitch (no pre-existing relationship),Rights: First Serial Rights,fiction,~750,2015
