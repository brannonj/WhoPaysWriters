"""I produced a monthly podcast for the alt paper New York Press. Each podcast was roughly 15 minutes long. Each episode was a feature about a particular NYC band and included an interview and live recording of the band. 

I was paid $250 for each episode. Payment came about a month after publication.

Unfortunately, the paper folded 1 year after they started releaseing the podcst.""","Contract: Verbal or ""handshake"" agreement",$0.08,False,Medium reporting,,ng-hide,Platform: other,New York Press,Ongoing/pre-existing relationship with editor or publication,Rights: Other / I don't know,feature,~3000,2014
