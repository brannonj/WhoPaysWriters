"""I find that the pay is good, but it generally takes months (including weeks of nagging and followups) to get paid by the Chronicle. If you need money in a reasonable time, don't work with them. If you're happy with exposure plus a surprise bonus someday, probably in four or five months, after you follow up every week starting at 60 days, take the job. The editorial staff are all lovely to work with, at least.""",Contract: Yes,$0.50,False,Medium reporting,Haven't gotten it yet (as of this reporting) ,svg-4,Platform: print,San Francisco Chronicle,Assignment (editor came to you),Rights: All rights,feature,800,2016
