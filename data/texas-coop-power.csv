"""Article was submitted on time, after trying to find out when it would run to steer the text to fit that season. The piece then sat for 4 months. The contract said ""payment on acceptance,"" and when I queried about the editing status about three weeks after submission, one editor said they generally ask for text early and then get to it months later, and that he guessed that could be a challenge for some freelancers. Another editor agreed to get it invoiced at that time, but the invoice sat unprocessed until I sent another reminder 2 months later (my fault to delay that check-in so long, but I do try not to pepper editors with questions and had other projects). When editing finally began 4 months after submission, the editor was not heavy handed and was helpful with general suggestions. However, by the time the article came out, 9 months after submission, the anecdotal lead with a time frame no longer worked. Instead of working with me (the contract noted the use of 2 rounds of collaborative editing with the writer) the editor markedly rearranged paragraphs without my input, then didn't bother with transitions. The new lead section was choppy as if thrown together. Had I been given a sense of what season -- not even the month -- the article would appear in while still writing the piece, or that the timing lead was a concern during editing when that finally happened, the situation could have turned out differently; the poor handling of payment was surprising regardless.""",Contract: ,$1.00,False,Medium reporting,Longer than 3 months ,svg-4,Platform: digital,Texas Co-op Power,Solicited pitch (editor asked you to pitch),Rights: First Serial Rights,feature,1200,2017
