"""To be clear, I never reached the point of writing this piece for GOOD. One of its digital editors came into an exclusive, invitation-only discussion board filled with professional writers and solicited pitches from us. I submitted two to the email address she provided (her own) and heard back from her with interest in one of them; alongside her response, she attached GOOD's contributor guide, which includes a fair amount of information about style/tone/length but nothing about rates. I wrote her back asking about rate structure, to which she didn't respond. A few days later, I followed up, asking if she was still interested in the story and, if so, would be willing to give me an idea of what sort of rate to expect. She wrote back immediately and passed on the piece without mentioning a reason why, nor clarifying anything about the magazine's payment policies, yet she asked me to pitch her again in the future as ideas arose. I thought this anecdote might be helpful for freelancers who might have otherwise considered taking time out of their day to pitch this publication.""",Contract: No,$0.00,False,Medium reporting,,svg-false,Platform: digital,Good Magazine,Solicited pitch (editor asked you to pitch),Rights: Other / I don't know,news story,700,2016
