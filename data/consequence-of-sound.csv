"""I had a timely submission and they asked for a four-hour deadline after accepting my pitch. They offered $50, but then fought for $75 since I'd written over 2,000 words when expected to not go over 1,200. The editor in chief ended up killing the piece last minute, after rigorous edits in an overbearingly timely fashion. They offered a $40 kill fee (after I inquired) but it's been a month and I have little hope of seeing it.""","Contract: Verbal or ""handshake"" agreement",$0.03,False,Medium reporting,Haven't gotten it yet (as of this reporting) ,svg-5,Platform: digital,Consequence Of Sound,Referral (you had a connection who connected you to the editor),Rights: Other / I don't know,,2500-word,2016
