"""I've worked with RBMA magazine for four years. At first they paid per word (and still do in some cases based on what other writers have told me) but now they apply a flat rate of 200 Euros ($220 approx) for profiles and short features and 500 Euros ($560 approx) for features that require more reporting, e.g. oral history. 

The editing is always good and payment is prompt. 

I've never had an official contract with them, written or verbal, but I do know that they've republished my content in print for their various promotional efforts worldwide. As such would consider the unspoken contract to be a sort of ""buy all rights"" even though I doubt there'd be an issue if you were to reprint elsewhere considering the lack of an actual agreement.
