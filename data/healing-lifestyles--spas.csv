"""Cold pitched the editor, she was thrilled with my idea, but then disclosed that for first articles they do not offer any compensation. They accept your work for free and don't pay so they can ""test the waters."" I do not agree with this policy, especially as an established journalist with 7 years in the field so I chose not to publish with them. While websites and Writer's Market report that the rates for this publication are $150-$500, the editor made it clear that a longer piece with multiple parts, medium reporting including reading research studies and original recipes would not be compensated on the higher end of that spectrum.""",Contract: ,$0.00,False,Medium reporting,,svg-false,Platform: digital,Healing Lifestyles & Spas,Cold pitch (no pre-existing relationship),Rights: Other / I don't know,feature,800,2018
