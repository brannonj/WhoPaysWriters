"""Terrible experience. Editor assigned story at 31p per word at 800 words. For two entire weeks after I submitted it, it sat un-edited. Suddenly one night she decided to edit it, without notice, and because I didn't respond to her questions within a 45-minute period (during which i was eating dinner), she cut the piece in half and published it, thus I was given only half the pay despite having done all the work. Terrible. I suggest making them promise in writing to pay you per words commissioned--not per words published--to avoid this happening again.""",Contract: ,$0.28,False,,Paid in 3 months ,svg-4,Platform: digital,The Guardian,,Rights: First Serial Rights,,800-word,2018
