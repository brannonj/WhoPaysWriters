"""The story took some light interviewing work with 4 different source, though they are all my friends so it wasn't hard to secure interviews. However, I should warn everyone that Glamour has a really rigorous fact-checking process and you're required to submit a LOT of detail about your interviewee, DOB, occupation, contact, on top of screenshots of your conversation, recordings, and transcriptions. The fact-checking department also 100% will reach out to your sources to confirm everything, so there may be a slight delay between filing and the piece being published.""",Contract: Yes,$0.31,False,Medium reporting,Paid in 1 month ,svg-2,Platform: digital,Glamour,Assignment (editor came to you),Rights: All rights,"opinion, editorial, column or essay",1300,2018
