"""The Real Deal LA pays $200/article. Minimum 400 words. You could do great enterprise, break an exclusive, be pushed back to re-writes, and it's still $200/article. That's not bad if you have a lot of real estate contacts and can convert leads into breaking within the day. But they keep the local editor busy so your draft just sits. By the time she gets to it, there might be more reporting out of new developments. More work but no more pay. Or, you block out a particular time to be ready to bounce back any edits and she's busy during that time, so you blow a couple hours in your afternoon here and there. That plus the time it takes to get paid makes this pub very, very not worth it.
