"""This piece was for Science of Us, which is now part of The Cut. Editor as great to work with--friendly with edits that improved the piece. But they don't pay anywhere near on time. Agreement was 30 net, but AP said the editor didn't send them the invoice until after the 30 day mark & said I needed to wait ""several more weeks"" for payment. AP ignored all emails saying that wasn't the agreement until I mentioned the new Freelance Isn't Free law. Within an hour, I had my money. One other gripe: A different magazine approached me wanting a reprint. Contract says requests have to go through New York Magazine as they take half of reprint fees. It's my understanding New York never responded, which means both they and I lost reprint revenue.""",Contract: Yes,$0.71,False,Little to no reporting,Paid in 2 months ,svg-4,Platform: digital,The Cut (New York Magazine),Cold pitch (no pre-existing relationship),Rights: First Serial Rights,"opinion, editorial, column or essay",984,2018

"""Submitted 1st week of December. Editor loved the piece, asked for photos, and gave a projected run date. Then she completely disappeared. A month later, the piece had begun to grow dated. Asked what was going on & got an OoO she was on maternity. A week passes, then a 2nd editor asks I rework the piece to update info & gives another run date. Shortly after, the editor emails, killing the article for ""thin writing"" (even she and the other editor both ""loved it"" for 5-6 weeks prior). I invoice the kill fee. Then the 2nd editor comes back and says they do want it and needs more changes. Then she emails killing it again. Fast forward to February. Invoice due date passes. I send 3 overdue notices. The 1st 2 times, the editor says ""policy says we don't handle that"" without saying who does. The 3rd time I finally get the name of someone in AP who says, our policy is 45 not 30 net. Note I never received a copy of this policy and my invoice clearly stated 30 net. Still don't have a policy copy. Well past the 45 day mark, AP then says it's just my bad luck that they haven't paid and I'll have to deal with it. Finally, AP gives a pay firm date, which passes without payment. Unsure if this is normal for all NYMag publications or just The Cut.""",Contract: Yes,$0.10,False,Medium reporting,Paid in 3 months ,svg-4,Platform: digital,The Cut (New York Magazine),Cold pitch (no pre-existing relationship),Rights: First Serial Rights,"criticism, review, or arts/entertainment coverage",834,2017
