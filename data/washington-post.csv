Once story was published, editor never responded to any of my further emails about payment and invoicing. Followed up repeatedly before giving up in anger and frustration, galled by the unprofessionalism. Am stunned if this is standard for the Post. Am even more surprised editors don't realize that writers share this sort of information, and that they don't care if they develop a reputation as a person and publication to avoid.""",Contract: No,$0.00,False,Little to no reporting,,svg-false,Platform: digital,Washington Post,Cold pitch (no pre-existing relationship),Rights: Other / I don't know,"opinion, editorial, column or essay",1000,2017
