"""The editor saw a piece that I had published on my own site, and asked me for permission to republish it on the Times Higher Education website (which has plenty of advertisements and sponsors). I asked the editor how much they paid, and he told me that he had no budget for the writing that he was publishing. So I told him, no, I wouldn't grant him a free license to publish my work.""",Contract: No,$0.00,False,Little to no reporting,,svg-false,Platform: digital,Times Higher Education,Other,Rights: Secondary Rights/Reprint,"opinion, editorial, column or essay",1000,2017
