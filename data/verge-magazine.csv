"""Send Verge a pitch if you want to spend the next 6 months of your life receiving weekly emails asking for “one last little edit” to your piece. Read: major rewrites, for as long as you can put up with it.
I sank at least 30-40 hours doing weekly rewrites (after already sending them a fairly polished feature on spec). 
Some of my weekly chores during this time included:
1. Repeatedly chasing down interviewees over and over and over and over again for minor details requested by the editor, over the period of nearly 6 months. Needless to say, I burned one or two contacts who got sick of me constantly bugging them.
2. One week being asked to reword a paragraph. The next week they want the paragraph deleted, then they want it put back in a week later, then taken out again, then reworded again, then deleted again etc etc.
3. Being told every week that this is pretty much the last round of edits before publication (maybe one or two more drafts, we’ll see).
4. Publication date gets pushed back again, the cycle of insanity starts over, and I rip another chunk of hair out of my scalp.
All up, over 6 months I did the equivalent of maybe 2 full weeks worth of full time work with them on the piece, even after spending another week putting together the on spec draft. 
All for $50. 
I have no idea how long that may have gone on for if I hadn’t pulled the plug, and told them I was going elsewhere. I think the decision hit them hard. They sent a few pretty emotional emails to myself and the alternative publisher with tears and threats of legal action.
Over $50.
In the end, they published my piece after all. The impression I got from one of their emails was that they published it to teach me a lesson or something. It would have been nice if they’d done so earlier, but better late than never I guess.""",Contract: Yes,$0.04,False,Medium reporting,Haven't gotten it yet (as of this reporting) ,svg-5,Platform: digital,Verge Magazine,Cold pitch (no pre-existing relationship),Rights: First Serial Rights,feature,1200,2017
"""Cold-pitched them in April 2015, piece was published as-is with no editing. Was promised $88 CAD (or $63.89 USD) upon publication but they paid me via PayPal's merchant option, rather than the Family & Friends option, so a nominal percentage was taken out of my fee, which the publication refused to cover. Also, they didn't stick to their own contract which said I would be paid via cheque.""",Contract: Yes,,,Little to no reporting,,ng-hide,Platform: digital,Verge Magazine,Cold pitch (no pre-existing relationship),Rights: First Serial Rights,"opinion, editorial, column or essay",~750,2016
