"""Was told by EiC all blog posts were $35. Although, I initially bargained the food editor to $40. According to the food editor food blog posts are $25.

Had one blog post run in the print edition (750 words roughly), wasn't informed of its printing, wasn't given a pay bump.

Same very painful payment terms as the S.F. Examiner (owner by the same company).
