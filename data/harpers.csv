"""Working with the online editor was frustrating. It took over seven months for my piece to make it up on the site, and during that time period, he was fairly uncommunicative. His vision for the piece ended up being very different from what I had written, and the piece, consequently was gutted. Perhaps things would have been different if we'd started out on the same page.""",Contract: No,$0.25,False,Heavy/Investigative reporting,Paid in 1 month ,svg-2,Platform: digital,Harper's,Cold pitch (no pre-existing relationship),Rights: First Serial Rights,blog post,2000,2016
