"""Editor had engaged me for previous online articles and had been (extremely) slow in paying. I threatened to pull the plug on this feature article, as he had already accepted it, in order to receive payment. Perhaps unsurprisingly, despite repeated promises that he would pay my invoice soon, he has never paid the 180 British Pounds that he offered for my article (despite it being published in print). In addition, he assured me there were sub-editors who would go through my article, but no-one did (was sent back the same copy I submitted to review in the finalised publication layouts).""","Contract: Verbal or ""handshake"" agreement",$0.00,False,Medium reporting,,ng-hide,Platform: print,De Magazine (or Design Exchange Magazine),Ongoing/pre-existing relationship with editor or publication,Rights: ,feature,~1500,2014
