"""I’ve been reaching out to Mitú for at least a month now. The listicle I input information for on this website was assigned to me after an editor emailed to say Mitú was looking for more writers. This was back in July of this year. I filed the piece, and never heard anything from them again until October when an editor there reached out to say he wanted me to pitch stories to him. At this point I was not exactly interested in working with Mitú since they lagged on my listicle, but I needed the money so I agreed to pitch him stories. I did so the following day and to this day the editor has never once replied to an email of mine. I want to make it clear that Mitú, for whatever reason, held on to this listicle I did for them for 4 months before publishing it. It’s been 30 days and I have not been paid my measly compensation, and no one at Mitú has ever gotten in touch with me regarding payment.""",Contract: Yes,$0.17,False,Little to no reporting,Haven't gotten it yet (as of this reporting) ,svg-5,Platform: digital,Fierce By Mitú,Assignment (editor came to you),Rights: Other / I don't know,other,800,2018
