"""Queried, wrote, & submitted story in March. Editor said would publish ""after Easter."" Throughout April & May, said they would publish ""soon."" In July, requested payment as agreement had been 30 net, not after publication & it had now been 4 months. Editor claimed to have never received story. Resent. She then claimed she had never received the invoice. Resent. She then claimed she had never requested the story and that I should have queried instead of writing it cold. Forwarded emails where I queried and where she accepted, requesting X # of interviews for the article, etc. Then her best friend called me (I'm not joking). Her friend had read the piece--an article about treating a certain condition after 50--and thought I should write a profile on a woman she knew with the condition instead. I said I would need payment on the first piece before beginning a new project. The friend then asked where I lived, asked if I liked to swim, said she had been to the farmers' market, yelled ""Stay wet,"" and hung up. The next day the editor emailed offering a kill fee, which I took, but she and her friend continued to call me nonstop, begging me to write a profile on this other woman and leaving ""helpful"" comments about how the industry really works because, in their opinion, I hadn't learned yet. The next weekend, I received the kill fee in the mail (rate entered reflects this--full amount would have been $300). The editor cut a personal check from her own bank account.""",Contract: No,$0.07,False,Medium reporting,Longer than 3 months ,svg-4,Platform: digital,Nycitywoman,Cold pitch (no pre-existing relationship),Rights: First Serial Rights,feature,1065,2017
