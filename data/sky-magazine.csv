"""Nice rates, paid on time, but wow what an editor. She introduced blatent factual errors to reporting, such as calling modern-day Russia ""the Soviet Union."" One change was borderline racist, saying a quoted source only received investment for her startup because she was an immigrant (note the piece had nothing to do with immigration, nor was immigration mentioned in submitted copy). Added so many random adjectives and phrases to the piece it became bloated prose I'm embarrassed to have my name on.""",Contract: Yes,$1.19,False,Medium reporting,Paid in 1 month ,svg-1,Platform: print,Sky Magazine,Cold pitch (no pre-existing relationship),Rights: Other / I don't know,feature,1006,2018
