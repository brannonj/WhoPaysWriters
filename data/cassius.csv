"""Bad doesn't even begin to describe my experience with Cassius. Before writing, I asked twice if Cassius had a contract and the editor said no. After filing AND invoicing, she said *I* was mistaken in assuming I didn't need a contract first, then sent one. It's so poorly drafted, it doesn't even clarify what rights they're buying. More than a month later, I told the editor payment was overdue. Begin the long barrage of her asking for random documents multiple times, including the invoice, which she claimed I hadn't sent despite *her having written an email acknowledging receipt.* Every time I checked on payment, she would take several days then ask for a resend of the invoice, the W9, or some other already provided paperwork, including direct deposit forms, which is interesting as when they did pay, it was by CHECK. Then she wants me to *revise* the invoice with preferred wording (changing ""May 2"" to ""5/2""). I said no, accusing them of trying to avoid payment and said if payment wasn't received within 2 weeks, I'd file a NYC Freelance Isn't Free complaint. The editor panicked, begging me not to in multiple emails, calling my cell over and over. I said no and received payment in less than a week.""",Contract: Yes,$0.05,False,Medium reporting,Paid in 3 months ,svg-4,Platform: digital,Cassius,Cold pitch (no pre-existing relationship),Rights: First Serial Rights,feature,1050,2018
