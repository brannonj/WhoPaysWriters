"""Original agreement was $1/word; submitted a 1500-word profile, they sent a contract for $1200 (presumably the amount of words they ended up publishing, but I never counted) with a 20% kill fee (not applicable if work was late or sub-standard); contract granted Hustler 90-day exclusive worldwide rights, with non-exclusive rights thereafter in perpetuity. Took a bit of time to get published (about 6 months), but payment was prompt; maybe a month or two after submission.""",Contract: Yes,$0.80,False,Medium reporting,,ng-hide,Platform: print,Hustler Magazine,Solicited pitch (editor asked you to pitch),Rights: All rights,profile or interview,~1500,2014
