"""Smithsonian website pays anywhere from $200 to $400 for news stories and Q&As and the like. Worked for them for years and could rarely negotiate a better rate once an editor made an offer/assignment. Editor typically sends at least one round of edits, no matter what. And once an editor outright told me a story I pitched was the sort of thing they'd just assign in-house and skip over the freelancer. That single strange and unprofessional exchange aside, working for the website editors is often a pleasant enough experience. But for mid- or later-career journalists, the time and money doesn't seem to worth it to work for the digital arm unless you have a story you are dying to write or can learn to manage an editor's expectations to cut down on endless edits. Print assignments are harder to come by but worth the actual work involved because the pay is so much better.""",Contract: ,$0.20,False,Medium reporting,Paid in 6 weeks ,svg-1,Platform: digital,Smithsonian Magazine,Assignment (editor came to you),Rights: Other / I don't know,profile or interview,1000,2019
