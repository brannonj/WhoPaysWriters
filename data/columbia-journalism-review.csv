"""Unprofessional doesn't even begin to describe them. After I filled 3 days early, the managing editor took over from the digital editor. Her changes gutted the piece, introducing factual errors -- not the accidental kind but ones that were in direct contradiction to quotes in copy filed (for ex, changing ""the source said X is true"" to ""the source says X is false""). Edits were in a shared Google Drive with no track changes and she moved the grafs around so much, they were hard to catch. Told my original editor I thought I'd corrected them all, but I wasn't sure. New editor continued sending changes & questions until 11 pm, also asking that I physically describe my male -- but not my female -- source: was he good looking, did he have dark hair, how old is he, etc. In the morning, the digital editor took back over, sending a Word doc from earlier in the night (meaning it didn't include the last two hours work), asking we keep new edits offline so the managing editor wouldn't know she was editing the piece differently behind her back. Meanwhile, I'm continuing to get edits from the managing editor and some third person on Drive. The Word also didn't have track changes on, so I wound up going back through my interview transcript to validate every statement, since I couldn't tell what was my copy, hers, or the other editor's. After I was done, the digital editor emailed to reiterate she didn't want the managing editor to see the new file, and also accused me of ignoring questions from the managing editor. (I did not.) 

I'm not sure what's going on here, but these intraoffice politics were taking hours for me to sort out and hurting the piece, making it not only unreadable but more inaccurate with every new version either editor sent. So I asked them not to run it. I won't get paid for my time and I'll have to eat the transcript costs, but I don't want my name anywhere near whatever sh*tshow these people have going on internally.""",Contract: Yes,$0.00,False,Medium reporting,,svg-false,Platform: digital,Columbia Journalism Review,Cold pitch (no pre-existing relationship),Rights: First Serial Rights,feature,1197,2018
