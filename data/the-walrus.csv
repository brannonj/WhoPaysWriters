"""Three months turnaround on an edit that completely contradicted the initial assignment. Filed a re-write, then another three months of polite, persistent emails for acknowledgement of receipt. Editor finally agreed to a kill fee (I had to ask more than once if the assignment was dead) only to suggest I invoice for only 75% of what I was contractually owed. I invoiced for the full amount was paid very promptly in about a week.""",Contract: Yes,$0.10,False,Medium reporting,Paid in 15 days ,svg-3,Platform: digital,The Walrus,Assignment (editor came to you),Rights: All rights,"opinion, editorial, column or essay",4000,2018

"""The piece was assigned in February, I submitted a final edit in March. In June, a ""fact checked and copy edited,"" clean, print-ready draft was returned to me that had completely rewritten without my input, which included significant new language and factual errors introduced by the fact checker. Flagging these changes and asking for a reverted draft resulted in the piece landing back in factcheck. The magazine refuses to accept an invoice for a piece before it has gone through this new fact check process. As a result we are ~5 months out from my submitting my final edits and my invoice has not been fulfilled or even accepted.""",Contract: Yes,$1.00,False,Medium reporting,Haven't gotten it yet (as of this reporting) ,svg-5,Platform: digital,The Walrus,Assignment (editor came to you),Rights: First Serial Rights,"opinion, editorial, column or essay",700,2018
