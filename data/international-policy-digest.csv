"""Wow, this publication seriously sucks. I followed their submission guidelines, which has no mention of payment and the editor said they would read my work and get back to me. Instead of getting back to me, they went ahead and published my writing (it was a pre-written review), which was confusing. When I asked about payment, they said there was none and referred me to the writing guidelines which does not mention anything about payment. I had them remove the post and, at first, felt bad for creating extra work for the editor, but really, they created the extra work for themselves. I would not recommend pitching here.""",Contract: No,$0.00,False,Medium reporting,,svg-false,Platform: digital,International Policy Digest,Cold pitch (no pre-existing relationship),Rights: Other / I don't know,"criticism, review, or arts/entertainment coverage",1600,2017
