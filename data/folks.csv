"""Editor was very difficult to deal with. Article was supposed to a positive essay on living with a particular learning disability. He changed it to a negative one, including symptoms that are not associated with the condition. To stigmatize the disability further, he introduced cliches and muddied the syntax until the essay read like a teenager had written it. After his third round of edits, he said each edit only took the article further from where he needed it to be, then killed the piece.""",Contract: No,$0.32,False,Little to no reporting,Paid in 6 weeks ,svg-2,Platform: print,Folks,Cold pitch (no pre-existing relationship),Rights: First Serial Rights,"opinion, editorial, column or essay",1250,2017
