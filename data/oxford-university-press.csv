"""Books tend to have ongoing royalties: 6% after the first 600 paperback copies (0% for the first 600). The initial print run was: 600 copies. (Luckily mine sold out and they did a second printing.) The book was based on my dissertation. I now have a student with a dissertation-based book ms accepted at Oxford University Press who was told they no longer pay *any* royalties for ""books based on dissertations"". 

Academics also typically get paid zero for chapters they write in edited volumes, for encyclopedia entries, and other smaller pieces (at least in the humanities). I'd love for you to expand your purview to include such writings as well, not just journalism. The for-profit publishers (Mouton, Sage, Elsevier, Springer, and many others) that work in my field make large profits (<5% annually) and pay nothing to the authors, editors, reviewers. (Or pay ""in kind"" = a copy of the book you contributed to, if you're lucky.)""",Contract: Yes,$0.02,False,Heavy/Investigative reporting,,ng-hide,Platform: print,Oxford University Press,Cold pitch (no pre-existing relationship),Rights: All rights,other,50000,2013
