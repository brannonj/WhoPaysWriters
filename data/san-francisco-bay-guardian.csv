"""San Francisco Bay Guardian was mothballed in mid-Oct., and check was not sent on as per the contract (was paid for a story published in another publication owned by same company 30 days after end of the month invoice, as per its contractually obligated payment schedule). 

After several emails and telephone calls to accounting, I got my money Nov. 12.

No relationship with editorial, but have done business with SF Media Co. in the past.""",Contract: Yes,$0.13,False,Medium reporting,,ng-hide,Platform: digital,San Francisco Bay Guardian,Cold pitch (no pre-existing relationship),Rights: Other / I don't know,news story,~750,2014
