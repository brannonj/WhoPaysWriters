"""Negotiate a contract including a kill fee before beginning to write for these guys. I pitched a story in late November and was then asked if I could get 900-1100 words to them. I understood that request to be an assignment and wrote a five-source story, then submitted it within four days of the assignment (for a weekly publication). More than a month later, the story appears to be nowhere near publication, and despite my sending of several emails, I can't get the publication to give me any information on why the story is stalled. It's extremely frustrating!""","Contract: Verbal or ""handshake"" agreement",$0.00,False,Medium reporting,,svg-false,Platform: other,Detroit Metro Times,Cold pitch (no pre-existing relationship),Rights: Other / I don't know,news story,1000,2019
