"""Editors were a pleasure to work with. Piece did go through 3 (minor) rounds of edits, but all edits were clearly to answer potential reader questions and make the piece better. VERY quick payment once an invoice was submitted--the piece hasn't even ran yet! Paid $50 extra per photo. Would love to write for them again!""",Contract: Yes,$0.64,False,Medium reporting,Paid in 15 days ,svg-1,Platform: digital,Successful Farming,Cold pitch (no pre-existing relationship),Rights: First Serial Rights,feature,1566,2017
