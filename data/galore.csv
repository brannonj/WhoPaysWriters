"""I just wanted to clarify that I did not end up submitting a piece that I pitched to Galore after I found out that they did not pay freelancers. I initially contacted one of the senior editors to see if they would be interested in publishing an interview that I had recently done with an artist and this is what she replied back: ""We don't have a budget for freelancers right now though unfortunately, so if you want to pitch to somewhere else that will pay, I understand. Let me know if you'd like to do it unpaid!""""",Contract: No,$0.00,False,Medium reporting,,svg-false,Platform: digital,Galore,Cold pitch (no pre-existing relationship),Rights: Other / I don't know,profile or interview,1000,2017
