"""What a hassle! Not only was editor very difficult to work with (odd, non-nonsensical edits, clearly was unfamiliar with subject), their payment process is a pain the in neck. They do not pay by direct deposit, check, or any conventional way, requiring you set up a Payoneer or PayPal account. And of course, the editor doesn't tell you this after the invoice is overdue due. Payment comes from an account in Israel so on top of Payoneer/PayPal's regular fees, you have to pay a foreign exchange fee that the editor also doesn't tell you about. So their crappy pay rate just keeps getting lower as you're paying fee after fee just to get some small amount of cash. Never writing for these people again!""",Contract: Yes,$0.19,False,Little to no reporting,Paid in 2 months ,svg-3,Platform: digital,Mental Floss,Cold pitch (no pre-existing relationship),Rights: Other / I don't know,fob,892,2018
