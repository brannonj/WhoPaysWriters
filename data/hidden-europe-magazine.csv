"""The contract was a fairly detailed e-mail which spelt out all I needed to know. 

Very meticulous editors, who deferentially consulted as necessary. Very good to work with. 

Payment was made well prior to publication. Really within 24 hours of the editors and I having agreed the final text. 

This is a niche magazine, very well managed, that has a reputation for very fair dealing with its writers. The rates are on the low side, but they don't accept ads in the magazine. And the magazine staff work hard to give texts good visibility.
