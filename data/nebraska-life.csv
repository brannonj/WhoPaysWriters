"""Terribly frustrating experience. Solicited idea and was immediately accepted. After submission, editor revised article to fit another angle, eliminating informative source quotes and specific information. Only 200 of 500 words were actually mine. Waste of time, especially as an unpaid gig to pad my fledgling portfolio. Untimely, unclear communication as well.""",Contract: No,$0.00,False,Medium reporting,,svg-false,Platform: digital,Nebraska Life,Cold pitch (no pre-existing relationship),Rights: Other / I don't know,fob,500,2017
