"""Editor offered $200 less for this piece than for articles the same length that I've written for them in the past, saying their budget was strapped. Agreed because I like the publication & wanted to write the story. Will not write for them again at this price, though. The piece required 9 sources and even though it was tied to a dated, news event, the editor waited 3 weeks to send me his edits. The edits took 4 hours to get through and were mainly defending the meticulous fact check I performed before writing against incorrect information the editor found in a Google search online. Then the editor killed the piece (rate provided Who Pays Writers? reflects this kill fee--had it published, payment would have been $300). He was polite in doing so, but I wish he hadn't said ""maybe you can place it elsewhere."" You can't place a breaking news story ""elsewhere"" 3 weeks after the event it's about it over.""",Contract: Yes,$0.07,False,Heavy/Investigative reporting,Paid in 1 month ,svg-1,Platform: digital,Discover,Ongoing/pre-existing relationship with editor or publication,Rights: First Serial Rights,feature,1481,2017
"""Despite the piece going through multiple edits and the editor saying he needed my sign off on any revisions before publication, the published piece included 7 exceptionally long paragraphs that I had never seen before. I'm not even sure whether they're factually correct since they covered something different from the rest of the article.""",Contract: Yes,$0.52,False,Medium reporting,Paid in 2 months ,svg-1,Platform: digital,Discover,Cold pitch (no pre-existing relationship),Rights: First Serial Rights,news story,958,2017
