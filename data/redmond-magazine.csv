"""Will not work w publication again. Editor is friendly, but remarkably poor at his job. From the get-go, he expected too wide of a topic range for the piece, asking me to combine unrelated elements. Then he added even more subjects to explore, which also were not related. After filing, the article went through multiple editing rounds. Despite these rounds, the published piece contained huge chunks of information I'd never seen. Writing quality for the new material was also poor--Faulknerian sentences with bad grammar that were difficult to understand. End result was something I'm ashamed to have my name on. Plus they paid late!""",Contract: Yes,$0.42,False,Medium reporting,Longer than 3 months ,svg-3,Platform: digital,Redmond Magazine,Other,Rights: Other / I don't know,feature,1806,2017
