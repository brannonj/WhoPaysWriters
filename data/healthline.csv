"""Editor assigned project over the holidays with little direction on what she wanted. I fulfilled her request to the best of my ability. Editor came back to me requesting a change of direction with additional reporting on the piece, giving me less than 24 hours to complete rewrites. I pushed back asking for at least 24 hours as I was already booked out for that day. Editor killed the assignment. I'm not sure I will be working with the publication again as I found it highly unprofessional.""",Contract: Yes,$0.05,False,Heavy/Investigative reporting,Paid in 1 month ,svg-3,Platform: digital,Healthline,Referral (you had a connection who connected you to the editor),Rights: All rights,news story,1000,2018
