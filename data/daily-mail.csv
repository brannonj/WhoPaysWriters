"""An event happened in Canada and I found out through a colleague that Daily Mail wanted info on the story. I found a unique story angle through an interview with someone involved in the event. I cold called them and sold them the interview transcript, the person's contact info and some notes from the field. One of their UK reporters followed up with contacts and wrote the story. I asked them to include me in the byline but they didn't.""",Contract: Yes,$0.88,False,Medium reporting,Paid in 2 months ,svg-3,Platform: other,Daily Mail,,Rights: All rights,profile or interview,600,2016
