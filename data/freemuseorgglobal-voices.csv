"""Global Voices doesn't pay (it's volunteer-run) but has an arrangement with Freemuse.org, which pays $100. Your article ends up posted on Artsfreedom.org, Global Voices, and Freemuse, and also reposted on other sites that link back to original and credit you as the author. It gets significant publicity even though it doesn't feel like a big-name publication.""",Contract: No,$0.13,False,Medium reporting,,ng-hide,Platform: digital,Freemuse.org/global Voices,Cold pitch (no pre-existing relationship),Rights: ,news story,~750,2014
