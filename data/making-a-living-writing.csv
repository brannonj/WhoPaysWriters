"""I've written three posts for the Make a Living Writing blog and have one scheduled for April. It's a great blog to write for. The editor is easy to work with, and payment is made at the beginning of every month via PayPal. Easy peasy. Plus, since they use PayPal's mass-pay service, there are ZERO fees taken out of what I earn. AND I get a great bio at the end of the posts with a link to my website, so I get great exposure along with payment. It's a Win/Win/Win. I highly recommend!""",Contract: Yes,$0.11,False,Medium reporting,Paid in 1 month ,svg-1,Platform: digital,Making A Living Writing,Ongoing/pre-existing relationship with editor or publication,Rights: First Serial Rights,blog post,700,2018
"""I wrote three articles for Make a Living Writing, all of which were expansions of posts I had published on my own blog. I explained to the editor that the articles were expansions on previous work, and he voiced no objection. I re-researched each article and composed original text before I submitted it. I was paid for each article, and the editor voiced no complaints. Six months later the owner of the site accused me of plagiarism. When I explained that I could not plagiarize my own work, she accused me of sending her reprints, which I had not. She then said she would keep my articles on her site, but remove my name from all of them. I do not recommend working with Carol Tice. She is erratic.""",Contract: No,$0.02,False,Medium reporting,Paid in 1 month ,svg-2,Platform: digital,Making A Living Writing,Cold pitch (no pre-existing relationship),Rights: Other / I don't know,blog post,4800,2018
