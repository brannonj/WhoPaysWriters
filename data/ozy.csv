"""Pain in the @ss client. The editor is professional, but has this really confusing, times-taking way of processing edits: You have to load each revision into the body of an email using a color-coded, bolding system with parenthetical notes inside the copy. She also added an additional interview in her edit requests. (If I'd known two interviews were required, I would have asked for a higher rate.) Before writing, I asked if there was a contract & she said no; after the piece was edited, she sent a contract that she said I had to sign if I wanted to be paid. The contract not only demanded full work for hire rights (I'd sold first-run) but also demanded I never write about the topic or anything connected to it again. I told her I of course couldn't sign that. For the next month, she continued saying they wouldn't pay until I signed. Then she sent an ""alternate"" contract that asked for the exact same rights as the first! Took three months to get paid.""",Contract: No,$0.35,False,Little to no reporting,Paid in 3 months ,svg-5,Platform: digital,Ozy,Referral (you had a connection who connected you to the editor),Rights: First Serial Rights,news story,852,2017
