"""Be very careful about reading their contracts.  I wasn't given a contract when I submitted my personal essay. After seeing my personal essay posted on several websites, I asked the editor about it because I didn't receive a contract. I was told that the same work-for-hire agreement I signed over a year ago is valid for a year. After a year has passed, I must submit in writing that I want a new contract. It wasn't worth it for $50 and a work-for-hire agreement.
