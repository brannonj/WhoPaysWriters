"""I write in Bustle's television department. Saw the job listing a few months ago and just applied, no prior relationship with the website. In the department, you're hired to write at least 5 articles a week for only $20 per article. No reviews. Writing about theories, spoilers, coming up with fresh angles for very popular tv shows. Editors are great, pay is abysmal considering how much work goes into the writing. Promptly get paid every two weeks via direct deposit.
