"""DNAinfo hired me as a contractor on a day rate of $150, which is paid every two weeks after invoicing, and gave me a schedule. About a month later, they suddenly changed the rate to per-piece with the assumption that the rate would also be $150/piece based on freelance pitches. I explain all of this because it felt a bit sleight-of-hand and I would warn others to be aware of frequent contract changes there.""",Contract: Yes,$0.40,False,Medium reporting,,ng-hide,Platform: digital,Dnainfo.com,Ongoing/pre-existing relationship with editor or publication,Rights: First Serial Rights,news story,~375,2014
