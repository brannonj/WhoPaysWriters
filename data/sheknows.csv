SheKnows used to pay $0.13 a word (as of 2010).
Their explanation of their current payment system is extremely confusing to the point of being deliberately misleading. All indications were that they paid $50 for an article (about $0.08 a word for a 600 word article), 45 days after publication. 
I just received an email from an editor stating that SheKnows now pays you NOTHING for an article, unless you write a product placement article as a ""brand sponsor."" 
This information was not included in their payment system description.
I'm seeing red right about now.
