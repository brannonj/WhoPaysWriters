"""The worst experience I've had with an editor. I pitched an article with a one page query to the editor of Dirt Rag, Eric McKeegan, and he responded that he'd like a 1,500 word piece and gave me a brief phrase to clarify the focus he'd like.

I got him the piece within the requested time frame and didn't hear back for weeks. I followed up and still didn't hear back. More weeks passed and then I contacted the publisher and soon received an email from the editor saying he'd take a look at the piece.

A few days later, he told me he didn't like it but gave no other details. After reminding him that I wrote it specifically based on his one-sentence description, I asked him what was unsatisfactory and what edits he'd like me to make.

He ignored this email and so I followed up weeks later asking if he had seen the email. Weeks later again, I explained that I'd need him to send me edits or pay me a kill fee. He didn't respond.

I've just sent another email to the publisher and if I don't get a response, I will be following up with my attorney.

Freelance journalism cannot thrive with editors like Eric McKeegan. If an editor asks a journalist to tailor-write a piece for him and then he declines, he must pay for the work in some fashion.""",Contract: ,$0.00,False,Heavy/Investigative reporting,,svg-false,Platform: other,Dirt Rag Magazine,Cold pitch (no pre-existing relationship),Rights: First Serial Rights,feature,1500,2018
