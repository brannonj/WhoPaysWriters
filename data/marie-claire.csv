"""Did not receive contract until after article had been submitted (article was NOT on spec--editor was just slow to send). Would have negotiated a higher price before writing had I seen the terms sooner. Also, they require a blank check before they can set up payment, which is difficult if you don't have checks anymore like most people! Editor changes added grammatical & punctuation errors to the work. That said, editor is polite & you only have to complete the paperwork once, so I would write for them again.""",Contract: Yes,$0.25,False,Little to no reporting,Paid in 2 months ,svg-3,Platform: digital,Marie Claire,Cold pitch (no pre-existing relationship),Rights: Other / I don't know,"criticism, review, or arts/entertainment coverage",986,2017
