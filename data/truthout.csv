"""Truthout is one of the more egregiously abusive publications I have written for. They do not pay their writers and they do not communicate with their writers.  When you ask for communication and are forced to write many times over five month's time, you get a snide response which reads like this: ""We don't have to communicate with you, if you don't like it, publish elsewhere.""  They are not worth writing for, even if they paid.""",Contract: ,$0.00,False,Heavy/Investigative reporting,,svg-false,Platform: digital,Truthout,Submission/spec (piece was written prior and then submitted for publication),Rights: Other / I don't know,news story,1200,2017
