"""In my experience, it seems that there can be such a discrepancy in pay rates between the print and online versions of media outlets — by a factor of 10 or booboosometimes even more — that it might be worth making that a little clearer by breaking such titles into two rather than notating whether it ran online or in print. That said, I realize that such outlets blur these lines when it suits them and sharpen them when it doesn't, so this might be so complicated as to be impossible to implement.""","Contract: Verbal or ""handshake"" agreement",$0.15,False,Heavy/Investigative reporting,Paid in 2 months ,svg-1,Platform: digital,The Atlantic,Referral (you had a connection who connected you to the editor),Rights: Other / I don't know,feature,2000,2018
