"""Worked with the editor on a piece for 5 months before submitting because every couple weeks, she'd change who she wanted interviewed or what the piece was about. Each change came with a lengthy conference call or email conversation. When she finally landed on an angle, she then wanted a final draft in than a week. Got it in before deadline. 2 months go by with no word, despite numerous emails from me to invoice, confirm receipt, etc. Then her revisions killing everything except one paragraph and asking that I change the subject matter completely. Before, the changes were at least tangentially related (from a recap to why the host organized the event, etc). This requested change was from a profile of one man's faith to a science article on animals. At this point, I'd worked on the piece for 7 months for a flat rate of $200. I refused, but offered to continue working on any edits on the existing topic. She then refused to pay me unless I gave her my notes so she could write the article in-house herself. I refused, and asked for the contact info of her EIC. She then lied and gave me the info for a friend on staff. Finally had to threaten to take the magazine to small claims to get my $200.
