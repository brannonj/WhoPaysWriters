"""My direct editor was great to work with, but Paste has been giving writers the run-around for months now, shirking payments with very little information or updates given. I've even exchanged multiple emails with the editor-in-chief/founder who essentially shrugged his shoulders at me when I asked when I could expect payment. If I didn't enjoy my direct editor so much, I would not write for Paste, and I would discourage any interested writers from pitching them.""",Contract: Yes,$0.04,False,Little to no reporting,Haven't gotten it yet (as of this reporting) ,svg-4,Platform: digital,Paste Magazine,,Rights: Other / I don't know,,500-word,2017

"""Will not write for this pub again. Editor was professional, enjoyed working with him, but payment was a nightmare. After publication, they asked that I resend the paperwork I'd already emailed by snail mail because they were no longer receiving it electronically. Mailed it in. A month passes & they ask that I resubmit it because they've changed what paperwork they require. They then ignored all emails checking on payment status until I threatened to turn them into collections. Then they emailed saying they'd pay by PayPal (which is not what we agreed on, since PayPal takes fees). Then, the day after they were supposed to pay by PayPal they said they couldn't pay because someone was out of the office and PayPal required a double signature. (Note PayPal does NOT have a double signature function.) Then when they paid, they offered to cover the fees, which was appreciated, but they didn't pay enough for the fees, so I still got short-changed. 

Note they also make you put the html in your article so headers can be bolded when it publishes online, etc. Editor did not tell me this before I accepted the rate and it takes forever!""",Contract: Yes,$0.10,False,Little to no reporting,Longer than 3 months ,svg-5,Platform: digital,Paste Magazine,Cold pitch (no pre-existing relationship),Rights: First Serial Rights,fob,754,2017
