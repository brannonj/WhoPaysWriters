"""I pitched to the New Republic when I was beginning my career as a freelance journalist. I was thrilled the hear back very quickly that they were interested in my story. After conducting a decent amount of research and writing the story within the word count parameters, my editor decided to kill it. He gave me very few reasons and the ones he gave me were absurd, and I wasn't the only person to think so. They paid me a kill fee, and I published the story elsewhere. A year later, they had two more experienced journalists write the exact same story. And I mean the EXACT same story. They didn't plagiarize my writing, but they obviously stole my pitch. It was the EXACT SAME STORY. DO NOT PITCH THE NEW REPUBLIC. They may have a historical reputation, but they are unabashed thieves. The editor claims that's not what they did, but it is literally the same story written by other people.""",Contract: Yes,$0.13,False,Medium reporting,Paid in 1 month ,svg-1,Platform: other,The New Republic,Cold pitch (no pre-existing relationship),Rights: Other / I don't know,"opinion, editorial, column or essay",1200,2018
"""Article was killed eight months after it was solicited and submitted. This was after monthly assurances that edits were on the way.
