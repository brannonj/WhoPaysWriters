"""They used to be good but sometime last fall, they changed their practices. Used to be prompt in paying but now seems like you'll never get paid. For my last invoice with them, I emailed their accounting department three times but have yet to receive a single email back (nor payment - now overdue 4+ months).

"""Great to deal with especially once you're in their stable of freelance writers. News-wise, they have a list of topics they want covered so if you're part of that stable, pitches tend to get easier (i.e. you can choose which topics you want to cover from their list). Publication also happens quickly for news (usually within a day of submission if there aren't any issues). Yes, they don't pay a lot ($20/piece) but the folks there are good to deal with plus they heavily promote your piece when it's out (i.e. 3x during the day of publishing and also 1x during their weekend ICYMI on Twitter, 1x on Facebook, and 1x on Tumblr).""",Contract: Yes,$0.04,False,Medium reporting,Haven't gotten it yet (as of this reporting) ,svg-3,Platform: digital,Kill Screen,Ongoing/pre-existing relationship with editor or publication,Rights: Other / I don't know,news story,500,2016
