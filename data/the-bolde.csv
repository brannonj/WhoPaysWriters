"""Over time, it became clear that they'd accept pitches with no defined schedule for publication (and they don't pay until they publish). I wrote 6 articles before I caught on. There are completed articles from other writers dating back to over a year ago that for whatever reason, never made it on the site. I emailed the editor to ask whether there's a schedule for publication, and if she'd inform me if edits were needed to my work before they were posted. I never received a response.""",Contract: No,$0.03,False,Little to no reporting,Paid in 15 days ,svg-3,Platform: digital,The Bolde,Cold pitch (no pre-existing relationship),Rights: All rights,"opinion, editorial, column or essay",850,2018
"""Been with The Bolde for some time now. Things were good at first but they seem to keep getting worse. The editors often chuck pieces they've asked for without asking for edits causing writers to spend hours on work and never receive a paycheck. Before they trashed pieces on occasion, but now it seems like a regular weekly habit. Seems like they have too many writers and no longer have a clear indication of what their publication is really about. They've also increased word requirements without increasing pay. At first I really liked this gig, I wish it would get back to the way it once was.""",Contract: Yes,$0.04,False,Little to no reporting,Paid in 15 days ,svg-3,Platform: digital,The Bolde,Ongoing/pre-existing relationship with editor or publication,Rights: All rights,"opinion, editorial, column or essay",800,2017
"""They keep taking on more writers, but they already have around 600 articles pending. They post a few articles each day but also repost existing articles. There is so much work backed up and some pieces the editors haven't got to in months. That means that writers still aren't getting paid/published for articles they wrote months ago. Things used to be much more steady and I cannot figure out why they're so behind. We get emails about new writers when there are already so many. They have also increased word count and the number of ledes required of each piece without increasing the pay, even for seasoned writers. At this point, the whole process has become quite frustrating.""",Contract: Yes,$0.04,False,Little to no reporting,Paid in 15 days ,svg-3,Platform: digital,The Bolde,Ongoing/pre-existing relationship with editor or publication,Rights: All rights,"opinion, editorial, column or essay",800,2017
