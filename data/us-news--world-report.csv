"""This article was the perfect example of how experiences with the same publication can vary radically by editor. When I'd written for them before, they paid early and edits were simple and geared toward making a better piece. This piece was my first time with a different editor there, and boy, was it a pain in the rump. First round of edits did nothing but gut the piece so the editor came back for a second round because now the piece was too short. And they paid a month late!""",Contract: Yes,$0.82,False,Medium reporting,Paid in 2 months ,svg-3,Platform: digital,U.s.
