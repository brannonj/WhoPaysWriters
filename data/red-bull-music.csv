"""Red Bull Music is separate from the Red Bull Music Academy magazine. I've done a job for the US Red Bull Music site, paid $500 for a short profile (1K words circa), but it was never published due to issues unrelated to the content. This job was for the UK Red Bull Music site, pay was lower but it was published this time. Payments are done via Red Bull's vendor system, it's fairly efficient and prompt for payments.
