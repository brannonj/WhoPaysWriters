"""Absolute nightmare of an experience. The editor emailed me, asking I write a third-person listing of three events happening in the town where I grew up. I delivered before deadline. Maybe a month later, despite asking a couple times for acknowledgement of receipt, I hadn't heard anything back so I went ahead and invoiced. The editor immediately responded, asking I rewrite the story as a first-person narrative about what it was like to grow up there. Since that's an entirely different article than what they commissioned, I asked for a kill fee on the first piece. Her boss then emailed me saying that changing the narrative voice and the subject was ""an easy change."" I pushed back. He then said that my original article could not be used because it was condescending. I asked for examples so I could fix this and he refused to provide any, saying it'd be a waste of his time, asking again to write a brand new article on a different topic for free. I reiterated that I was not going to write 1 article for the price of one and that I would need the industry standard 25% kill fee for the first. He then tried to negotiate a lower kill fee. When I refused, he emailed over a contract then said if I didn't sign this, they wouldn't pay anything (keep in mind almost two months have passed at this point since delivery). Of course, the contract had the lower kill fee rate he'd tried to negotiate. He finally agreed to the standard 25% kill fee, but it took them another month and a half to pay that.""",Contract: Yes,$0.19,False,Little to no reporting,Paid in 3 months ,svg-4,Platform: print,Southwest: The Magazine (In-flight Magazine Of Southwest Airlines),Assignment (editor came to you),Rights: Other / I don't know,fob,263,2017
