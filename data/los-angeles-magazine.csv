[After it ran in print,] for $0, I cleaned up my interview transcript and filed a Q & A for the mag's website. Frankly, it is against my rules to do work that is unpaid, but I felt the company deserved the exposure.""",Contract: Yes,$1.20,False,Medium reporting,,ng-hide,Platform: digital,Los Angeles Magazine,Cold pitch (no pre-existing relationship),Rights: First Serial Rights,fob,~125,2014
