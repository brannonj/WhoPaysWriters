"""Editor killed article after learning I was not a porn star using a pen name (no idea where she got an idea this absolutely insane), offering a kill fee. I told her if she wanted a kill fee option, she should have noted that in a contract upfront and the full amount was due. (Seriously? A porn star?!?!) She then proceeded to simply ignore my emails requesting payment, so I threatened to turn Cosmo into NYC Freelance Isn't Free. Eventually got an email from her boss saying a contract I signed maybe 2 years ago for Marie Claire (yes, an entirely different magazine) included a kill fee option, so legally they didn't have to pay. She then offered -- out of the goodness of her heart -- to pay in full. She did not offer any insight as to why this exceptionally young editor thought I had a shadow career in porn. Took more than a month and one more reminder to the editor's boss for payment to arrive.""",Contract: No,$0.23,False,Medium reporting,Longer than 3 months ,svg-4,Platform: digital,Cosmopolitan,Cold pitch (no pre-existing relationship),Rights: First Serial Rights,profile or interview,959,2018
