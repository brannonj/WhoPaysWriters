"""The editor completely rewrote my piece. I don't mean edited, I mean wrote an entirely different piece--so different my byline felt like plagiarism. There were two sentences left that I wrote. He had good reason (it was a heavy news week so between submission and publication, part grew outdated), but it's disheartening as a writer to spend 7 hours crafting something you're highly proud of just to have it annihilated. Plus, ethically it just makes me feel smarmy to have my name on something I didn't write. That said, the editor was highly professional. I would write for them again, but preferably for a different editor or with much less time invested in the piece.""",Contract: No,$0.31,False,Medium reporting,Paid in 15 days ,svg-2,Platform: digital,The Intercept,Cold pitch (no pre-existing relationship),Rights: First Serial Rights,news story,983,2017
