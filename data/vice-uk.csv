"""Pay rate is actually Â£0.20. Given short deadline, and editor then took 2 months to get back to me - but I was busy and had forgotten to prompt them. But, it was a pleasure to work with them, no rewrites or edits, article went up on expected date, and just sent invoice to editor who passed it on for me. Was paid on time (30 days after publication date). No contract, but I have worked like that previously.""",Contract: No,$0.20,False,Medium reporting,Paid in 1 month ,svg-1,Platform: digital,Vice (uk),Cold pitch (no pre-existing relationship),Rights: Other / I don't know,feature,1400,2017
