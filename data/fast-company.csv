"""Worst editor experience of my career. At least 4 rounds of edits. Edits were erratic with no connection to piece. Each round introduced a brand new subject matter & distorted focus until the article had no coherent idea or narrative. Assignment was how machine learning could prevent school shootings. Edits included an entire page on sniper training & eating at McDonald's. Half of published piece was material I'd never seen, including quotes from a source I'd never heard of. Prior to writing, editor refused to issue a contract, even though he said Fast Company has one. He also ignored 7 emails requesting payment for my overdue invoice, as well as an official letter from NYC re: Freelance Isn't Free. Only when I drew up small claims paperwork, did he connect me to a different editor who paid a week later with no apology for my 166 day wait.""",Contract: No,$0.27,False,Heavy/Investigative reporting,Longer than 3 months ,svg-5,Platform: digital,Fast Company,Cold pitch (no pre-existing relationship),Rights: First Serial Rights,news story,1458,2018
"""I took this assignment on the request of an old friend/colleague, who knew I had a particular interest in the topic. The pay rate was significantly lower than my standard (and of FC print, which is $2/word), and the research was substantial, though not on an investigative level. It also took nearly two months to get paid, which is longer than it should have. But the piece turned out really well, and my editor actually improved it, adding a number of sidebars that really filled out the piece nicely. 

Still, when he asked if I was interested in writing another piece of a similar nature, I turned him down, because the ratio of research to revenue was too high.""",Contract: No,$0.35,False,Medium reporting,Paid in 3 months ,svg-3,Platform: digital,Fast Company,Ongoing/pre-existing relationship with editor or publication,Rights: All rights,feature,2000,2018
