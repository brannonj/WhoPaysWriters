"""I wrote a quarterly column for Modern on the design/decorative arts auction market that 'paid' $250 for a 500-600 wd explainer on a top-selling auction lot.  Was promised payment and given the runaround as to why payments were chronically outstanding.  Stopped writing after 4 columns (and smaller, paid FOB pieces) when my invoices topped $1,000+.  After almost daily harassment, received check for $850.  Extracting remaining balance has been like pulling teeth; editor has been rude, defensive, and patently unprofessional.

Would NOT recommend engaging with Brant Publications on any level. A total shitshow from top to bottom.""","Contract: Verbal or ""handshake"" agreement",$0.00,False,Medium reporting,,ng-hide,Platform: print,Modern Magazine,Ongoing/pre-existing relationship with editor or publication,Rights: ,fob,~750,2013
