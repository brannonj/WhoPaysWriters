"""For years, this magazine was one of the most freelancer-friendly in the industry. That has changed. While the print publication pays very quickly and still well by industry standards, the editorial tone and process is dramatically different, including the amount of editing hassles (rude editors insert mistakes or don't know/understand topic for which they assign/edit in first place) and last-minute copy changes the writer sees too late to correct. Perfectly good publication ruined by editor egos.""",Contract: Yes,$1.50,False,Heavy/Investigative reporting,Paid in 1 month ,svg-1,Platform: digital,Entrepreneur Magazine,Assignment (editor came to you),Rights: All rights,fob,900,2018
"""Remarkably poor communication from the editor led to my withdrawing the piece. He originally asked I write a profile. I asked about rates but didn't hear back before deadline, so I submitted anyway. Two weeks later & still no word as to whether it had even been received. After my second call to make the article hadn't gone into spam, the editor asked I change the profile to a top 10 list. I reminded him we still hadn't agreed on rates and he said Entrepreneur doesn't pay! Sure would have been nice to know before the 1st draft! Said no thanks & withdrew the piece.""","Contract: Verbal or ""handshake"" agreement",$0.00,False,Medium reporting,,svg-false,Platform: other,Entrepreneur Magazine,Cold pitch (no pre-existing relationship),Rights: First Serial Rights,profile or interview,557,2016
