"""Sunset has run into some financial/mgmt issues since being bought by Regent LP private equity firm. I've worked with them (writing and shooting) for years and they always paid within 30 days. Now I've one invoice thats three months overdue and three others a month overdue. Troubling part is, there's little to no recourse since most of editors have turned over, including EIC. Regent accounts payable is unresponsive to my inquiries.
