No ""reporting"" involved but prepping, transcribing and editing this took massive. amounts. of. time. I was on vacation with my family when this came out and they were all super impressed. I then realized that they think I make pretty decent money as a writer. When I told them the $50 figure it was like the curtain on the tabernacle ripped, they realized there is no God and space is vast, empty and cruel. They honestly thought I was typing away and checks were rolling in and it was all so jolly and nice. I felt a little bit bad for them. And really embarrassed because it's not my fault that no one pays but somehow I felt that when they learned the truth they didn't think I was a ""real"" writer any more, when the moment before they had basking in the reflected glory of having a Writer in the family. God, this is sad.

"""Boy, were these folks hard to work with. [The editor] who assigned the piece took it upon herself to rewrite my entire article. The version she sent back for my approval contained many clich√©s and factual errors that made it seem as if the reviewer hadn't read the book. I had to write to the managing editor to get my piece restored to the version I wrote (with acceptable edits). But before the article was published, another reviewer's piece on the same book ran ahead of mine, without the editor's knowledge. My piece eventually ran, however, but neither editor apologized. This piece was one of their most retweeted articles of the year. This was a lot of work and aggravation for $50.""",Contract: No,$0.02,False,Medium reporting,,ng-hide,Platform: digital,Los Angeles Review Of Books,Assignment (editor came to you),Rights: First Serial Rights,"criticism, review, or arts/entertainment converage",~3000,2014
