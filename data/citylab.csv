"""Piece went through maybe 5 edit rounds because the editor kept introducing new factual errors and also because he shifted the piece's focus, requiring a rewrite, after the 1st round. He had never been to the area before but obviously had an idea in his head of what it was like and kept trying to twist the story to his preconceived idea instead of printing the truth. I spent around 2 hours total trying to convince him that his edits were factually incorrect (for example, he changed 1 sentence to read that the town was in a mountain valley when it's 7 hours from the closest mountain range, he added ""facts"" from an incorrect Wikipedia entry, etc). In the end, it ran with untrue information because it was--in his opinion--what his readers wanted to hear. He was very polite, but I will never write for him again.""",Contract: Yes,$0.43,False,Medium reporting,Paid in 6 weeks ,svg-1,Platform: digital,Citylab,Cold pitch (no pre-existing relationship),Rights: Other / I don't know,feature,812,2017
