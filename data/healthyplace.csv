"""HealthyPlace contracts writers for a minimum of 1 year to write for their blogs at the rate of $20 per post. They typically require 2 blog posts a year and one video, totaling $60 per year. They do not make payment rates available until an offer is made. When I applied, I expected that I would be offered professional rates due to the reputation of the website as a whole. They are basically selling the job based on ""exposure,"" but don't let writers know until after applying. Each writer gets to choose whether they will write for low rates and exposure, but I believe they should have that information before taking the time to apply, which consists of 1-2 unique writing samples. All work is also subject to heavy editing, which the writer does not get a say in.""",Contract: Yes,$0.03,False,Little to no reporting,Paid in 1 month ,svg-1,Platform: digital,Healthyplace,Ongoing/pre-existing relationship with editor or publication,Rights: All rights,blog post,800,2018
