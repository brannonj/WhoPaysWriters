"""Editor was fine to work with, but payment was a nightmare. Every time I asked about it. the editor said payment would be sent next week. The third time I heard this, I brought up the Freelance Isn't Free law. Then lo and behold a clerical error had been found where the check had already been mailed! It of course doesn't show, so they tell me I need to call USPS. Give it another week and whoops they admit they didn't mail the check, and add they'd love to mail it today, but you know, it's snowing in Detroit. (Seriously.) Asked how snow in an entirely different city meant they couldn't pay and accused them of lying. Payment arrived via PayPal same day.""",Contract: Yes,$0.21,False,Little to no reporting,Paid in 2 months ,svg-4,Platform: digital,Agdaily,Cold pitch (no pre-existing relationship),Rights: First Serial Rights,"opinion, editorial, column or essay",713,2018
