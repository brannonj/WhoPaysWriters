"""I pitched this article to the editor and heard back right away. However, after writing the article I didn't hear from her for 3 weeks. After hearing back, she asked me to re-format the entire article. I did so, and didn't hear back again for another month, after sending 4 emails that went unaswered. 
When she finally did get back to me, she had changed her mind, and I was asked to re-format the article, again! This is all for an article that was for no pay, and I was doing it to get a clip for my portfolio. 
When the article was finally published, she had completely butchered it, and changed almost every single sentence I wrote. On top of that, I found 4 typos just in the first 2 paragraphs. 
Very disappointed with this publication, terrible editing, and awful communication. It wasn't worth the headache, even if they had paid me. 
I would advise that you stay away!""",Contract: No,$0.00,False,Medium reporting,,svg-false,Platform: digital,Suitcase Magazine,Cold pitch (no pre-existing relationship),Rights: First Serial Rights,feature,1200,2018
