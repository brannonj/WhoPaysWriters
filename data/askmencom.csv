"""Was supposed to be paid $350, but have had to report them to NY city government under Freelance Isn't Free for non-payment. Work done & invoiced in June. This is December. Still don't have my money & they keep changing contact (5 different people!) and asking I resend the invoice & submit tax paperwork, etc over & over again. Not to mention the editor said he loved my piece then a month later asked I COMPLETELY rewrite it because of changes on his end. These people suck.""",Contract: No,$0.00,False,Medium reporting,,svg-false,Platform: digital,Askmen.com,Cold pitch (no pre-existing relationship),Rights: Other / I don't know,feature,1000,2018
