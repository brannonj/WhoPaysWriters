"""The worst experience I've had with an editor. I pitched an article with a one page query to the editor of Dirt Rag, Eric McKeegan, and he responded that he'd like a 1,500 word piece and gave me a brief phrase to clarify the focus he'd like.

I got him the piece within the requested time frame and didn't hear back for weeks. I followed up and still didn't hear back. More weeks passed and then I contacted the publisher and soon received an email from the editor saying he'd take a look at the piece.

A few days later, he told me he didn't like it but gave no other details. After reminding him that I wrote it specifically based on his one-sentence description, I asked him what was unsatisfactory and what edits he'd like me to make.

He ignored this email and so I followed up weeks later asking if he had seen the email. Weeks later again, I explained that I'd need him to send me edits or pay me a kill fee. He didn't respond.

I've just sent another email to the publisher and if I don't get a response, I will be following up with my attorney.

And once an editor outright told me a story I pitched was the sort of thing they'd just assign in-house and skip over the freelancer. That single strange and unprofessional exchange aside, working for the website editors is often a pleasant enough experience. But for mid- or later-career journalists, the time and money doesn't seem to worth it to work for the digital arm unless you have a story you are dying to write or can learn to manage an editor's expectations to cut down on endless edits.

"""Send Verge a pitch if you want to spend the next 6 months of your life receiving weekly emails asking for “one last little edit” to your piece. Read: major rewrites, for as long as you can put up with it.
I sank at least 30-40 hours doing weekly rewrites (after already sending them a fairly polished feature on spec). 
Some of my weekly chores during this time included:
1. Repeatedly chasing down interviewees over and over and over and over again for minor details requested by the editor, over the period of nearly 6 months. Needless to say, I burned one or two contacts who got sick of me constantly bugging them.
2. One week being asked to reword a paragraph. The next week they want the paragraph deleted, then they want it put back in a week later, then taken out again, then reworded again, then deleted again etc etc.
3. Being told every week that this is pretty much the last round of edits before publication (maybe one or two more drafts, we’ll see).
4. Publication date gets pushed back again, the cycle of insanity starts over, and I rip another chunk of hair out of my scalp.
All up, over 6 months I did the equivalent of maybe 2 full weeks worth of full time work with them on the piece, even after spending another week putting together the on spec draft. 
All for $50. 
I have no idea how long that may have gone on for if I hadn’t pulled the plug, and told them I was going elsewhere. I think the decision hit them hard. They sent a few pretty emotional emails to myself and the alternative publisher with tears and threats of legal action.
Over $50.
In the end, they published my piece after all. The impression I got from one of their emails was that they published it to teach me a lesson or something.

"""Submitted 1st week of December. Editor loved the piece, asked for photos, and gave a projected run date. Then she completely disappeared. A month later, the piece had begun to grow dated. Asked what was going on & got an OoO she was on maternity. A week passes, then a 2nd editor asks I rework the piece to update info & gives another run date. Shortly after, the editor emails, killing the article for ""thin writing"" (even she and the other editor both ""loved it"" for 5-6 weeks prior). I invoice the kill fee. Then the 2nd editor comes back and says they do want it and needs more changes. Then she emails killing it again. Fast forward to February. Invoice due date passes. I send 3 overdue notices. The 1st 2 times, the editor says ""policy says we don't handle that"" without saying who does. The 3rd time I finally get the name of someone in AP who says, our policy is 45 not 30 net. Note I never received a copy of this policy and my invoice clearly stated 30 net. Still don't have a policy copy. Well past the 45 day mark, AP then says it's just my bad luck that they haven't paid and I'll have to deal with it. Finally, AP gives a pay firm date, which passes without payment.

"""Article was submitted on time, after trying to find out when it would run to steer the text to fit that season. The piece then sat for 4 months. The contract said ""payment on acceptance,"" and when I queried about the editing status about three weeks after submission, one editor said they generally ask for text early and then get to it months later, and that he guessed that could be a challenge for some freelancers. Another editor agreed to get it invoiced at that time, but the invoice sat unprocessed until I sent another reminder 2 months later (my fault to delay that check-in so long, but I do try not to pepper editors with questions and had other projects). When editing finally began 4 months after submission, the editor was not heavy handed and was helpful with general suggestions. However, by the time the article came out, 9 months after submission, the anecdotal lead with a time frame no longer worked. Instead of working with me (the contract noted the use of 2 rounds of collaborative editing with the writer) the editor markedly rearranged paragraphs without my input, then didn't bother with transitions. The new lead section was choppy as if thrown together.

"""To be clear, I never reached the point of writing this piece for GOOD. One of its digital editors came into an exclusive, invitation-only discussion board filled with professional writers and solicited pitches from us. I submitted two to the email address she provided (her own) and heard back from her with interest in one of them; alongside her response, she attached GOOD's contributor guide, which includes a fair amount of information about style/tone/length but nothing about rates. I wrote her back asking about rate structure, to which she didn't respond. A few days later, I followed up, asking if she was still interested in the story and, if so, would be willing to give me an idea of what sort of rate to expect. She wrote back immediately and passed on the piece without mentioning a reason why, nor clarifying anything about the magazine's payment policies, yet she asked me to pitch her again in the future as ideas arose.

They then ignored all emails checking on payment status until I threatened to turn them into collections. Then they emailed saying they'd pay by PayPal (which is not what we agreed on, since PayPal takes fees). Then, the day after they were supposed to pay by PayPal they said they couldn't pay because someone was out of the office and PayPal required a double signature. (Note PayPal does NOT have a double signature function.) Then when they paid, they offered to cover the fees, which was appreciated, but they didn't pay enough for the fees, so I still got short-changed.

Two years on, a very different story. I submitted a new article in late 2017, but not until almost FIVE MONTHS later did they respond. It is supposed to be only a few weeks before they let you know one way or the other. They did accept it in the end, and after this point I was paid within a month. I am less bothered about the payment time, even if longer than in 2016, more about the absurd length of time it took to tell me if they wanted it or not. Also, in 2016 the article length was requested as being 1200-1500 words maximum, now it has to be at least 1800, but the amount of money you are paid - $100 - is still the same as it was two years ago, so you have to write more without getting paid more.

"""Unprofessional doesn't even begin to describe them. After I filled 3 days early, the managing editor took over from the digital editor. Her changes gutted the piece, introducing factual errors -- not the accidental kind but ones that were in direct contradiction to quotes in copy filed (for ex, changing ""the source said X is true"" to ""the source says X is false""). Edits were in a shared Google Drive with no track changes and she moved the grafs around so much, they were hard to catch. Told my original editor I thought I'd corrected them all, but I wasn't sure. New editor continued sending changes & questions until 11 pm, also asking that I physically describe my male -- but not my female -- source: was he good looking, did he have dark hair, how old is he, etc. In the morning, the digital editor took back over, sending a Word doc from earlier in the night (meaning it didn't include the last two hours work), asking we keep new edits offline so the managing editor wouldn't know she was editing the piece differently behind her back. Meanwhile, I'm continuing to get edits from the managing editor and some third person on Drive. The Word also didn't have track changes on, so I wound up going back through my interview transcript to validate every statement, since I couldn't tell what was my copy, hers, or the other editor's. After I was done, the digital editor emailed to reiterate she didn't want the managing editor to see the new file, and also accused me of ignoring questions from the managing editor. (I did not.) 

I'm not sure what's going on here, but these intraoffice politics were taking hours for me to sort out and hurting the piece, making it not only unreadable but more inaccurate with every new version either editor sent. So I asked them not to run it. I won't get paid for my time and I'll have to eat the transcript costs, but I don't want my name anywhere near whatever sh*tshow these people have going on internally.""",Contract: Yes,$0.00,False,Medium reporting,,svg-false,Platform: digital,Columbia Journalism Review,Cold pitch (no pre-existing relationship),Rights: First Serial Rights,feature,1197,2018

The next day the editor emailed offering a kill fee, which I took, but she and her friend continued to call me nonstop, begging me to write a profile on this other woman and leaving ""helpful"" comments about how the industry really works because, in their opinion, I hadn't learned yet.

Her boss then emailed me saying that changing the narrative voice and the subject was ""an easy change."" I pushed back.

I asked for examples so I could fix this and he refused to provide any, saying it'd be a waste of his time, asking again to write a brand new article on a different topic for free. I reiterated that I was not going to write 1 article for the price of one and that I would need the industry standard 25% kill fee for the first. He then tried to negotiate a lower kill fee. When I refused, he emailed over a contract then said if I didn't sign this, they wouldn't pay anything (keep in mind almost two months have passed at this point since delivery).
