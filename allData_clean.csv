Got it in before deadline. 2 months go by with no word, despite numerous emails from me to invoice, confirm receipt, etc. Then her revisions killing everything except one paragraph and asking that I change the subject matter completely. Before, the changes were at least tangentially related (from a recap to why the host organized the event, etc). This requested change was from a profile of one man's faith to a science article on animals. At this point, I'd worked on the piece for 7 months for a flat rate of $200. I refused, but offered to continue working on any edits on the existing topic. She then refused to pay me unless I gave her my notes so she could write the article in-house herself.

I pitched an article with a one page query to the editor of Dirt Rag, Eric McKeegan, and he responded that he'd like a 1,500 word piece and gave me a brief phrase to clarify the focus he'd like.

I got him the piece within the requested time frame and didn't hear back for weeks. I followed up and still didn't hear back. More weeks passed and then I contacted the publisher and soon received an email from the editor saying he'd take a look at the piece.

A few days later, he told me he didn't like it but gave no other details. After reminding him that I wrote it specifically based on his one-sentence description, I asked him what was unsatisfactory and what edits he'd like me to make.

He ignored this email and so I followed up weeks later asking if he had seen the email. Weeks later again, I explained that I'd need him to send me edits or pay me a kill fee. He didn't respond.

I've just sent another email to the publisher and if I don't get a response, I will be following up with my attorney.

Read: major rewrites, for as long as you can put up with it.
I sank at least 30-40 hours doing weekly rewrites (after already sending them a fairly polished feature on spec). 
Some of my weekly chores during this time included:
1. Repeatedly chasing down interviewees over and over and over and over again for minor details requested by the editor, over the period of nearly 6 months. Needless to say, I burned one or two contacts who got sick of me constantly bugging them.
2. One week being asked to reword a paragraph. The next week they want the paragraph deleted, then they want it put back in a week later, then taken out again, then reworded again, then deleted again etc etc.
3. Being told every week that this is pretty much the last round of edits before publication (maybe one or two more drafts, we’ll see).
4. Publication date gets pushed back again, the cycle of insanity starts over, and I rip another chunk of hair out of my scalp.
All up, over 6 months I did the equivalent of maybe 2 full weeks worth of full time work with them on the piece, even after spending another week putting together the on spec draft. 
All for $50. 
I have no idea how long that may have gone on for if I hadn’t pulled the plug, and told them I was going elsewhere. I think the decision hit them hard. They sent a few pretty emotional emails to myself and the alternative publisher with tears and threats of legal action.
Over $50.
In the end, they published my piece after all. The impression I got from one of their emails was that they published it to teach me a lesson or something. It would have been nice if they’d done so earlier, but better late than never I guess."""

SheKnows used to pay $0.13 a word (as of 2010).
Their explanation of their current payment system is extremely confusing to the point of being deliberately misleading. All indications were that they paid $50 for an article (about $0.08 a word for a 600 word article), 45 days after publication. 
I just received an email from an editor stating that SheKnows now pays you NOTHING for an article, unless you write a product placement article as a ""brand sponsor.""

The piece then sat for 4 months. The contract said ""payment on acceptance,"" and when I queried about the editing status about three weeks after submission, one editor said they generally ask for text early and then get to it months later, and that he guessed that could be a challenge for some freelancers. Another editor agreed to get it invoiced at that time, but the invoice sat unprocessed until I sent another reminder 2 months later (my fault to delay that check-in so long, but I do try not to pepper editors with questions and had other projects). When editing finally began 4 months after submission, the editor was not heavy handed and was helpful with general suggestions. However, by the time the article came out, 9 months after submission, the anecdotal lead with a time frame no longer worked. Instead of working with me (the contract noted the use of 2 rounds of collaborative editing with the writer) the editor markedly rearranged paragraphs without my input, then didn't bother with transitions. The new lead section was choppy as if thrown together. Had I been given a sense of what season -- not even the month -- the article would appear in while still writing the piece, or that the timing lead was a concern during editing when that finally happened, the situation could have turned out differently; the poor handling of payment was surprising regardless."""

After I filled 3 days early, the managing editor took over from the digital editor. Her changes gutted the piece, introducing factual errors -- not the accidental kind but ones that were in direct contradiction to quotes in copy filed (for ex, changing ""the source said X is true"" to ""the source says X is false""). Edits were in a shared Google Drive with no track changes and she moved the grafs around so much, they were hard to catch. Told my original editor I thought I'd corrected them all, but I wasn't sure. New editor continued sending changes & questions until 11 pm, also asking that I physically describe my male -- but not my female -- source: was he good looking, did he have dark hair, how old is he, etc. In the morning, the digital editor took back over, sending a Word doc from earlier in the night (meaning it didn't include the last two hours work), asking we keep new edits offline so the managing editor wouldn't know she was editing the piece differently behind her back. Meanwhile, I'm continuing to get edits from the managing editor and some third person on Drive. The Word also didn't have track changes on, so I wound up going back through my interview transcript to validate every statement, since I couldn't tell what was my copy, hers, or the other editor's. After I was done, the digital editor emailed to reiterate she didn't want the managing editor to see the new file, and also accused me of ignoring questions from the managing editor. (I did not.) 

I'm not sure what's going on here, but these intraoffice politics were taking hours for me to sort out and hurting the piece, making it not only unreadable but more inaccurate with every new version either editor sent. So I asked them not to run it. I won't get paid for my time and I'll have to eat the transcript costs, but I don't want my name anywhere near whatever sh*tshow these people have going on internally."""

The friend then asked where I lived, asked if I liked to swim, said she had been to the farmers' market, yelled ""Stay wet,"" and hung up. The next day the editor emailed offering a kill fee, which I took, but she and her friend continued to call me nonstop, begging me to write a profile on this other woman and leaving ""helpful"" comments about how the industry really works because, in their opinion, I hadn't learned yet. The next weekend, I received the kill fee in the mail (rate entered reflects this--full amount would have been $300). The editor cut a personal check from her own bank account."""

The editor immediately responded, asking I rewrite the story as a first-person narrative about what it was like to grow up there. Since that's an entirely different article than what they commissioned, I asked for a kill fee on the first piece. Her boss then emailed me saying that changing the narrative voice and the subject was ""an easy change."" I pushed back. He then said that my original article could not be used because it was condescending. I asked for examples so I could fix this and he refused to provide any, saying it'd be a waste of his time, asking again to write a brand new article on a different topic for free. I reiterated that I was not going to write 1 article for the price of one and that I would need the industry standard 25% kill fee for the first. He then tried to negotiate a lower kill fee. When I refused, he emailed over a contract then said if I didn't sign this, they wouldn't pay anything (keep in mind almost two months have passed at this point since delivery). Of course, the contract had the lower kill fee rate he'd tried to negotiate. He finally agreed to the standard 25% kill fee, but it took them another month and a half to pay that."""

Agreed because I like the publication & wanted to write the story. Will not write for them again at this price, though. The piece required 9 sources and even though it was tied to a dated, news event, the editor waited 3 weeks to send me his edits. The edits took 4 hours to get through and were mainly defending the meticulous fact check I performed before writing against incorrect information the editor found in a Google search online. Then the editor killed the piece (rate provided Who Pays Writers? reflects this kill fee--had it published, payment would have been $300). He was polite in doing so, but I wish he hadn't said ""maybe you can place it elsewhere."" You can't place a breaking news story ""elsewhere"" 3 weeks after the event it's about it over."""

I do not agree with this policy, especially as an established journalist with 7 years in the field so I chose not to publish with them.
